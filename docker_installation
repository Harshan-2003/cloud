Setting up the Docker repository

1. First, install the prerequisites required to add an additional repository over HTTPS and update the software package list:

sudo apt install apt-transport
2. Use the next curl command to bring in the repository's GPG encryption key:

curl -fsSL ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
3. To your machine, add the following Docker APT repository:

sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64]

1. Open the terminal on Ubuntu.

2. Remove any Docker files that are running in the system, using the following command:

7. Pull an image from the Docker hub using the following command:

$ sudo docker run hello-world
Here, hello-world is the docker image present on the Docker hub.

8. Check if the docker image has been pulled and is present in your system using the following command:

$ sudo docker images
9. To display all the containers pulled, use the following command:
